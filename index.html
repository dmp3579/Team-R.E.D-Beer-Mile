            <p>The Beer Mile is a super fun event allowing us to bring together three great                    things! Beer, Running and Fundraising!</p>
            <h2>How does the Beer Mile work?</h2>
            <p>When the race director says "Go" you will drink one 12 ounce beer then run a                    quarter mile, then repeat the process three times. This results in the consumption                of four beers and the running of four quarter miles (hence the beer mile)</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>The Rules</h2>
            <p>1. Each competitor drinks four cans of beer and runs four laps (start - beer, then             lap, then beer, then lap, then beer, then lap - finish).
            <br>
						<br>
            2. Beer must be consumed before the lap is begun, within the transition area which is             the 10 meter zone before the start/finish line.
            <br>
						<br>
            3. Competitors who vomit before they finish the race must complete one penalty lap at             the end of the race (immediately after the completion of their 4th lap). 
						<br><i>Note: Vomitting more than once during the race still requires only one penalty lap at the end.</i> 
            <br>
						<br>
            4. Each participant must define a designated sober driver, or reserve a car through a             taxi/limo provider, or use public transportation to get home from the event. Safety               first people!</p>
